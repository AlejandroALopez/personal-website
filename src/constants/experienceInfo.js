      "The most remarkable features I developed were personalized group meeting scheduling (previously the app could only do 1:1s), more flexible scheduling (monthly, weekly, biweekly, etc.), allow user to display their company logo on the app, edit follow-up notes, and bug fixes on the whole app.",

      "The partners at the Lionheart Foundation created a program called EQ2, which trains and supports direct care staff working with high-risk, trauma-impacted youth (e.g. youth involved in child welfare or juvenile detention systems). As part of this program, they envisioned a mobile app to help with such process.",
      "During the first term, me alongside 2 DALI developers created the frontend, backend, and database for the app, building around 2/3 of the final product in 10 weeks. The second term was during the summer break, and I worked as a solo developer in the project to finish the remaining features and deploy a usable version.",
      "Some of the features developed involve using AWS S3 to retrieve video and audio for the app, a progress system where the user moves through modules by watching instructive videos, and a flexible goal-tracking system to encourage frequent use of the app.",
      "The EQ2 app was released from the lab as an alpha version, and the partners were provided both the codebase and a Testflight build for further development and testing.",

      "Dr. Matthew R. Babineau and Dr. Jennifer V. Pope work at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), and they contacted DALI to develop a mobile app to help emergency doctors run probabilistic diagnoses quickly yet informed. The main feature of the app was to allow doctors to input a patientâ€™s symptoms and the app uses data from medical literature and Bayesian inference to compute likelihoods for different possible underlying diseases.",
      "After the first term at DALI, our team managed to create an MVP with core functionality accessible through Expo. The second term, the team focused on improving this MVP to be more user-friendly, intuitive, and functional, resulting in an alpha version in Testflight.",
      "Currently, the app is ready to be used for gathering funding for the project that plans to use it, so DHMC residents and doctors can use it to aid their decision-making.",

As part of this team, I helped two DALI teams with Full Stack development tasks. ",
      "The first team was Mgame, a React web app to encourage patients to achieve their recovery goals. I worked with them for 4 weeks, improving their landing page and creating a dashboard with graphs from Chart.js.",
      "The second team was Smart Microscope, a project that uses computer vision to create images of microorganism that can be sent to a special microscope, letting the user study and magnify such images as they would do with real organisms in a laboratory. I helped them by creating a user-friendly React frontend so users can manage the images to display, their information, and many other details.",
